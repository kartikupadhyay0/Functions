    "\n",
    " Ans: Generators in Python are a type of iterable, similar to lists or tuples, but they generate items on-the-fly and are more memory efficient. They are defined using a function that contains one or more yield statements instead of return. When a generator function is called, it returns a generator object without executing the function body immediately. Each time next() is called on the generator, execution resumes until it hits the next yield, returning that value.\n",
